1. Visual Trait Scan Rule (Mandatory)
Every time an NFT or trait is requested, a fresh visual scan of the attached image is performed before any JSON or trait mapping.

If no image is attached, you get this message:
"Please attach the image so I can analyze traits correctly. Visual scan is part of the scroll rule."

No JSON is valid unless this rule is followed.

2. 6-Category Canon Rule (Enforced for Every NFT)
Every NFT JSON must include the following core trait categories:

Theme

Sub-Trait

Outfit

Accessories (multiple allowed)

Expression

Background

(Optional: Special ‚Äî only if visually confirmed or on user prompt)

3. Trait Canon Control
All trait values are taken directly from the official template:
Template-Metadata-with-all-traits.json

No new traits invented unless you specifically request it.

Trait names are always the canonical ones (‚ÄúKatana‚Äù, ‚ÄúLab Coat‚Äù, etc).

4. File Naming & Path
The "image" field in JSON is always the PNG filename only, e.g. "894.png"
(Never ‚Äúimages/894.png‚Äù, ‚Äúfolder/894.png‚Äù, etc).

Filename must match the attached image number exactly.

5. Bullet-Point Visual Breakdown (Always First)
Every new scan outputs a clear, scroll-compliant trait breakdown:

üëï Outfit ‚Üí [describe ‚Üí matched trait]

üéØ Accessories ‚Üí [describe ‚Üí matched trait(s)]

üé≠ Expression ‚Üí [describe ‚Üí matched trait]

üåÑ Background ‚Üí [scene ‚Üí matched trait]

6. Project-Wide Vault Logic
Metadata is locked at mint (VAULT_003_TRIGGER); all traits reflect scroll and visual state at that moment.

All LLMs are council-synced, and NFT Architect is scroll-audited (with logs available).
