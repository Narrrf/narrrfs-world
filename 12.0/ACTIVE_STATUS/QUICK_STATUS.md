Last Updated: April 16, 2026
Status: ✅ LIVE — REWARD CHAMBER (LOOTBOX 3 SYSTEM) FULLY INTEGRATED + BACKEND-AUTHORITATIVE REWARD FLOW + ADMIN CONFIG + PROFILE TOP-LEVEL UI
Version: 2026-04-16
Milestone: Reward Chamber has transitioned from static/manual chest behavior to a dynamic admin-controlled economy system with authoritative backend execution

---

## 🔄 UPDATE — APRIL 16, 2026

### 🎁 REWARD CHAMBER — STATUS: ✅ LIVE (PRE-PUSH VALIDATED)

The Reward Chamber system is now fully implemented across:

- Backend (authoritative reward logic)
- Admin interface (configuration layer)
- Profile frontend (player-facing UI)

### 🧠 BACKEND ARCHITECTURE (CRITICAL)

The Reward Chamber system is now **backend-authoritative**.

APIs:

- `api/user/get-reward-boxes.php` → read-only chamber state
  - Handles cooldowns
  - Handles availability
  - Handles pricing
  - Handles DSPOINC balance
  - Handles reward summaries

Reference:
- `api/user/get-reward-boxes.php`

- `api/user/open-reward-box.php` → executes reward logic
  - Handles DSPOINC spending
  - Handles reward distribution
  - Handles weighted reward pool logic
  - Handles fallback rewards
  - Handles premium claim creation
  - Handles atomic updates

Reference:
- `api/user/open-reward-box.php`

### 🎮 BOX SYSTEM OVERVIEW

#### Box Type 1 — Free DSPOINC Box

- Free daily reward
- Cooldown-based
- Migrates legacy chest behavior

#### Box Type 2 — Lucky Cheese Loot (Paid)

- Costs DSPOINC
- Rewards include:
  - store items
  - genetic items
  - fallback DSPOINC
- Uses weighted reward pool

#### Box Type 3 — Royal Cheese Mystery

- Premium rewards
- Creates **pending admin claim**
- Requires manual fulfillment

### 🧩 ADMIN INTERFACE INTEGRATION

The Reward Chamber is now fully configurable via admin panel:

- New tab: **🎁 Reward Chamber**
- Endpoint: `/api/admin/reward-chamber-config.php`
- Integrated into fetch patch system

Reference:
- `api/admin/reward-chamber-config.php`
- `public/admin-interface.html`

Admin can now control:

- box activation
- cooldowns
- pricing
- reward pools
- weights
- fallback behavior

### 🧑‍🚀 FRONTEND INTEGRATION

#### Profile Page Upgrade

- Reward Chamber moved to **top-level feature**
- Replaces legacy chest UX
- Fully synced with backend APIs

Reference:
- `public/profile.html`
- `api/user/get-reward-boxes.php`
- `api/user/open-reward-box.php`

Features:

- Live cooldown display
- Dynamic availability
- DSPOINC balance sync
- Action buttons (open / disabled / cooldown)

### 🔐 AUTH & SESSION (IMPORTANT CONTEXT)

System depends on:

- Discord session (`discord_id`)
- Session-first validation
- Localhost fallback for dev

This ensures:

- secure reward execution
- no frontend manipulation possible

### ⚠️ KNOWN SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS

- Backend is the **single source of truth**
- Frontend is **display-only**
- No reward logic exists in frontend
- SQLite-safe (no `FOR UPDATE`)
- All rewards tracked in:
  - `tbl_user_scores`
  - `tbl_score_adjustments`

### 🧪 PRE-PUSH VALIDATION STATUS

Completed:

- UI rendering ✔
- API connectivity ✔
- Admin config sync ✔
- Session handling ✔

Required final tests:

- Box 1 cooldown loop
- Box 2 DSPOINC spend + reward types
- Box 3 premium claim creation

### 📈 NEXT PHASE

#### Phase 1 (Immediate)

- Push to production
- Monitor reward flows
- Validate economy balance

#### Phase 2

- Admin Claim Management Panel (Box 3)
- Reward analytics dashboard

#### Phase 3

- Economy balancing (weights, pricing, drop rates)

### 🧠 FINAL SYSTEM STATE

The project has successfully transitioned from:

❌ static / manual chest system
➡️ to
✅ dynamic, admin-controlled, backend-authoritative reward system

This is now a **core economy feature**, not just a UI element.

---

## 🔄 UPDATE — APRIL 13, 2026

### 🌐 GLOBAL AUTH SYSTEM — LIVE

The Narrrfs World ecosystem now uses a **centralized session hydration system**:

- `/api/user/get-session.php` introduced
- `discord-config.js` extended to auto-load session on all pages
- `window.sessionDiscordId` now globally available

### 🧀 AUTH UI LAYER — DEPLOYED

- Floating Cheese Auth Indicator active across pages
- Reflects real login state
- Provides consistent entry point for auth

### 🧬 LAB AUTH FIX — RESOLVED

- Removed hardcoded session reset in `lab.html`
- Lab now respects backend session
- Eliminates cross-page login inconsistency

### ⚠️ CURRENT STATE

- `discord_id` → fully working (authoritative)
- `discord_username` → optional, not yet in session

System is stable and ready for production validation.

---

## 📋 TODAY — APRIL 8, 2026

✅ `public/lab.html` remains the progression hub  
✅ Genesis and Genetic progression lanes remain separated by authority rules  
✅ Backend authority remains the source of truth for ownership, timers, costs, unlocks, and state transitions  
✅ Admin Player Profile console now surfaces Genesis ability state per verified Genesis mouse

---

## ✅ NEW WORKING ABILITY STATUS

### Genesis Ability Matrix is now working across live system layers

**Confirmed working now:**
- `api/user/get-nft-ability-upgrades.php` (read matrix)
- `api/user/start-nft-ability-upgrade.php` (start upgrade)
- timer creation and active upgrading state
- DSPOINC validation + deduction
- one active ability upgrade per NFT enforcement
- `public/lab.html` renders Genesis ability tabs/cards/queue
- `public/admin-interface.html` Player Profile console now shows Genesis ability data
- `api/admin/get-player-lab.php` is now the admin-safe backend source for ability visibility

**This confirms:**
- system is no longer backend-foundation only
- Genesis Ability Matrix is now visible in both player-facing Lab and admin operator view
- current phase is moving from core wiring into production polish / cleanup / player testing

---

## 🧬 GENESIS ABILITY MATRIX — CURRENT TRUTH

Locked model:
- Fitness → HP / SPEED / AIR
- Weapons → ATK / DEF / SPECIAL
- Education → SPELLS / CRAFTING / EXPANSION
- unlock source = highest single Genesis trait level on that NFT
- cap = 100
- one active ability upgrade per NFT
- NFT-bound progression only (`token_id` + `collection`)

SQL foundation confirmed:
- `tbl_nft_ability_upgrades`
- `tbl_nft_ability_upgrade_history`

Confirmed backend files:
- `api/user/genesis-ability-helpers.php`
- `api/user/get-nft-ability-upgrades.php`
- `api/user/start-nft-ability-upgrade.php`

Confirmed frontend/admin surfaces:
- `public/lab.html`
- `public/admin-interface.html`
- `api/admin/get-player-lab.php`

---

## ✅ WHAT IS NOW WORKING

### 1) Genesis ability backend loop
- verified Genesis ownership loading works
- selected Genesis NFT loading works
- 9-row ability matrix seeding works
- unlock map returns
- DSPOINC returns
- start-upgrade flow works
- upgrade row moves into `upgrading`
- timer state persists correctly

### 2) Lab UI visibility
- Genesis Ability Matrix section exists in `lab.html`
- tabs/cards render under selected Genesis mouse
- queue box renders ability upgrade separately from trait upgrade
- ability state / level / duration / cost display now visible
- start-upgrade action is wired through current Lab flow

### 3) Admin Player Profile visibility
- Player Profile Operator Console now has Genesis ability visibility
- admin can inspect Genesis ability levels by verified NFT
- upgraded levels are visible in admin profile console
- admin visibility is read-first, not force-edit-first
- this follows the intended safe operator model

---

## 🔓 GENETIC ACCESS RULE SPLIT (LIVE)

✅ Genetic lane is Discord-authenticated and user-bound

Live direction includes:
- genetic shop buys via Discord-authenticated access
- genetic marketplace buying/listing via Discord-authenticated access
- genetic upgrade start/claim aligned to Discord-authenticated access
- genetic instant-finish path exists but still needs final parity/polish review

✅ Genesis lane remains holder-protected and NFT-authoritative

Live direction includes:
- Genesis trait progression remains NFT-bound
- Genesis ability progression remains NFT-bound
- Genesis ability state is NOT user inventory
- holder authority and Genetic authority remain separated

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT TEST / PRODUCTION NOTE

Temporary testing unlock values have been used during local validation.

Current helper file snapshot shows:
- Fitness = 5
- Weapons = 20
- Education = 30

Production target remains:
- Fitness = 10
- Weapons = 20
- Education = 30

Before production push, confirm `NFT_ABILITY_UNLOCK_LEVELS` in `api/user/genesis-ability-helpers.php` is restored to intended production values.

---

## ⚠️ STILL NOT DONE YET

1) Final Lab polish
- upgrade card visual polish
- queue styling polish
- disabled/locked/maxed states final pass
- confirm no hidden regressions in booster / trait chamber areas

2) Profile integration
- player-facing `profile.html` still needs Genesis ability summary visibility
- keep profile as viewer/identity surface, not authority

3) Admin polish
- verify all players load correctly in Player Profile console
- confirm `ability_by_token` payload remains stable for multiple verified Genesis mice
- keep admin ability visibility read-only first

4) Instant finish policy
- Genesis ability instant finish is still outside locked v1 scope unless intentionally expanded
- do not accidentally imply live support if backend path is not formally approved

5) Docs / wording pass
- remove stale holder-era Genetic wording
- refresh old updates/docs pages
- clean old milestone copy in outdated public pages

---

## 🚨 DO NOT BREAK

- Do not merge Genesis ability data into `tbl_user_genetic_items`
- Do not weaken Genesis holder-gated authority
- Do not make Genesis abilities Discord-user-bound
- Do not mix trait/ability queue items without clear labels
- Do not let admin visibility become admin force-editing before read stability is confirmed

---

## 🧠 STRATEGIC STATE

✅ Genesis Lane
- NFT-bound
- holder-protected
- trait + ability progression
- admin visibility now present

✅ Genetic Lane
- Discord-bound
- user inventory + upgrades + marketplace
- open to Discord-authenticated users

✅ Shared Rules
- backend authoritative
- Genesis authority and Genetic authority remain separated
- Lab is still the progression hub

• removed hard dependency on missing `mint` column in `tbl_nft_ownership`
• aligned score adjustment insert with real local schema
• corrected `action` value to supported ledger action set
• aligned trait-level helper usage with working read API path

⚠️ Temporary local test state active:
• `NFT_ABILITY_UNLOCK_LEVELS` in `genesis-ability-helpers.php` are temporarily set to `1 / 2 / 3` for localhost testing
• before production they must be restored to:
  • Fitness = 10

⚠️ Still not done yet:
• `public/lab.html` Genesis Ability Matrix UI not wired yet
• Lab queue integration for ability upgrades not wired yet
• profile summary visibility for Genesis abilities not wired yet
• admin read visibility for Genesis abilities not wired yet
• wording cleanup still open in docs/pages

🎯 CURRENT PRIORITIES
Priority 1 — Wire Genesis Ability Matrix into `public/lab.html`

• add section inside Selected Genesis Mouse area
• 3 always-visible tabs: Fitness / Weapons / Education
• 3 cards per tab
• each card shows stat name / current level / state / next duration / next cost / upgrade button
• locked categories must show required trait level
• disable other ability upgrade buttons when same NFT already has active ability upgrade

Priority 2 — Lab queue integration

• render active Genesis ability upgrades separately from Genesis trait upgrades
• clearly label them as ability upgrades
• no claim button in v1
• auto-complete remains read-driven

Priority 3 — Profile summary integration

• viewer only, not authority
• show selected/best Genesis mouse summary
• show unlock state + notable ability levels

Priority 4 — Admin read visibility

• Player Profiles / Genesis lane
• show verified Genesis mice
• show 9-stat matrix per selected NFT
• show unlock state
• show active upgrade if present
• read visibility only first

Priority 5 — wording cleanup

• `profile.html` still has some old holder-era Genetic wording
• `nerd-lab.html` still has old holder-exclusive wording/metadata language
• `project-updates.html` still has stale milestone copy like old alpha testing banner

� DO NOT BREAK
• do not merge Genesis ability state into `tbl_user_genetic_items`
• do not weaken Genesis holder protection
• do not overload `tbl_nft_trait_upgrades` with ability data
• do not make Genesis abilities Discord-user-bound
• do not let ability upgrades visually merge into trait queue without clear labels

🚨 KNOWN RISK AREAS (UPDATED)

• Genesis ability unlock logic must stay tied to highest single Genesis trait level
• Genesis ability upgrades must not weaken holder-gated Genesis access
• Genesis ability rows must stay NFT-bound by token_id + collection
• Genesis ability system must not be merged into user-bound Genetic inventory
• queue UX may confuse Genesis trait upgrades vs Genesis ability upgrades if not clearly labeled

📁 KEY FILES NOW
• `QUICK_STATUS.md`
• `api/user/genesis-ability-helpers.php`
• `api/user/get-nft-ability-upgrades.php`

verified Genesis NFT collection

selected NFT detail state

trait research chamber

research queue

knowledge / explainer layer

✅ Core long-term architecture locked and implemented in working form:

verified NFT scan = immutable identity layer

trait upgrade table = progression layer

lab page = runtime merge of both

✅ This ensures:

upgrades belong to the NFT

current verified owner can use them

if NFT is sold and a new owner verifies it, progression remains with that NFT

verified scan data itself is never corrupted by progression logic

✅ Verified Genesis NFTs now render in lab

✅ Lab UX direction significantly advanced beyond the old dev-style version

✅ Genesis Lab now behaves more like a real gameplay hub and less like a raw developer overview

✅ Product direction now clearly locked as:

identity hub

NFT gallery / featured viewer

progression screen

trait upgrade chamber

future gameplay integration point

✅ Verified Genesis display direction changed from grid-first to featured viewer + slider pattern

✅ New structure now supports:

trait_value

✅ Upgrade system applies to exact trait value on exact NFT

✅ Locked progression rules preserved:

Genesis only

verified saved NFTs only

upgrades bound to exact NFT trait values

immutable verified NFT scan

separate progression table

1 active upgrade per NFT

infinite progression

exponential timing:

1→2 = 24h

2→3 = 48h

3→4 = 96h

doubles forward

explicit manual claim after finish

DSPOINC instant finish supported as progression path

✅ Upgrade backend first wave connected and working locally:

api/user/get-nft-trait-upgrades.php

api/user/start-nft-trait-upgrade.php

api/user/complete-nft-trait-upgrade.php

api/user/instant-finish-nft-trait-upgrade.php

✅ Local endpoint now returns:

success

verified_genesis_nfts

upgrades

✅ Upgrade table schema fixed locally

✅ Critical local SQL issue previously resolved:

old table lacked upgrade_id

✅ tbl_nft_trait_upgrades recreated with correct schema

✅ Table now supports:

upgrade_id

token_id

collection

trait_type

trait_value

current_level

upgrade_status

upgrade_started_at

upgrade_ends_at

last_completed_at

timestamps

✅ This unblocked lab progression loading

✅ Full player upgrade loop now tested deeper than before:

start upgrade works

timers update

ready state displays

claim flow tested

instant finish path working

Discord notification integration working

✅ Important claim-state bug investigated and narrowed to frontend/server time interpretation mismatch risk

✅ Frontend time / readiness handling now recognized as a stability-sensitive area

✅ Discord DM Ready-to-Claim Notification System (NEW / WORKING):

✅ Discord bot now monitors ready-to-claim trait upgrades

✅ When a trait upgrade becomes ready, the bot DMs the matching Discord user

✅ DM includes:

NFT token / Genesis identifier

trait

level info

claim context

direct lab link

✅ Notification architecture added safely through bot-side polling against live DB

✅ No lab frontend notification hack used

✅ Stable bot-side design chosen intentionally

✅ New DB fields added to tbl_nft_trait_upgrades:

ready_claim_notified_at

ready_claim_notification_count

✅ Notification state reset / lifecycle integrated into upgrade flow

✅ Bot monitor now respects “send once per cycle” logic

✅ This created the first live player-return loop for Lab progression

cheese-gold attention styling

mint-green / cyan accent styling

animated pulse border direction

✅ Wording refined away from “specimen” and toward:

mouse

Genesis mouse

chamber

chamber slot

Genesis needed / chamber expansion direction

✅ Research Queue UX improved

✅ Queue now better supports actionable mouse navigation

✅ Direct flow added from queue / slider toward the actual research chamber

✅ Current slider/research navigation remains in active hardening because page-scroll behavior must stay stable on all screens

⚠️ Known remaining lab issues

⚠️ Slider / chamber jump behavior was improved but still remains a sensitive UX area when combining:

selection rerender

horizontal slider sync

scroll-to-research behavior

⚠️ Some recent “View Research” / chamber jump interactions caused page scroll bounce and need final stability-safe refinement

⚠️ Research Queue quick actions still need final polish so they always land cleanly in the actual chamber without scroll conflicts

⚠️ Runtime log / developer-facing log output still exists in the page and should be reduced or hidden for final player-facing polish

⚠️ Timezone / frontend readiness display remains a known sensitive area for claim-state truth if timestamps are interpreted differently in browser vs backend

⚠️ Selected NFT / trait chamber still needs final UX polish

⚠️ Economy-safe DSPOINC instant-finish audit still pending

⚠️ Final mobile-first polish still needed for some viewer / slider / chamber interactions

✅ backend progression rows working locally

✅ claim + instant finish + DM loop substantially advanced

🔄 final production hardening and scroll/UX stabilization still ongoing

🎯 CURRENT PRIORITIES
Priority 1 — Finish Lab Production Hardening

finalize slider / chamber scroll behavior

finalize research queue jump flow

finalize selected NFT chamber UX

finalize trait research chamber UX polish

verify claim-state truth under all time conditions

remove misleading warnings / dev-facing leftovers

harden race-condition protection

Priority 2 — Expand Player Identity

continue richer player profile visibility

integrate progression state later into:

admin interface

Discord bot

game runtime readers

Priority 3 — Complete Admin Restoration

continue remaining admin tabs one by one

verify API calls

verify rendering

remove legacy fields safely

Priority 4 — Future Gameplay Integration

trait levels later drive:

multipliers

weapons

bonuses

unlocks

but gameplay consumption should not be wired until progression stability is fully proven

🚨 KNOWN RISK AREAS

ownership drift from stale verification data

duplicate upgrade starts from multi-click / multi-tab behavior

trait mismatch if exact trait keys are not enforced

DSPOINC instant-finish audit safety

infinite progression duration scaling at very high levels

frontend/backend time interpretation mismatch for ready/claim state

scroll bounce / UI race conditions in slider → chamber navigation

admin restoration regressions if done too broadly

All known. All should remain on incremental, stability-first handling.

📝 TIMELINE SYNC NOTE

This quick status has now been updated beyond the March 17 baseline and synced with the major March 18–19 work stream, especially:

lab UX restructuring

selected Genesis viewer + slider direction

mint CTA / chamber expansion messaging

Discord DM ready-to-claim notifications

active trait visual highlight work

tab emphasis / game-style lab theming

research queue and slider action improvements

scroll/jump hardening work

This closes the newest timeline gap between the earlier local lab baseline and the current player-facing Lab expansion work.
