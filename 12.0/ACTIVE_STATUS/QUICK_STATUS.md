🧀 NARRRFS WORLD 13.0 - QUICK STATUS

Last Updated: March 19, 2026 🎯 STABLE – LIVE ECOSYSTEM + LAB SYSTEM EXPANSION ACTIVE
Status: ✅ Season 9 LIVE – core website, admin, staking, verification, Discord runtime, and Genesis Lab progression flow stable-first and actively expanding
Version: 2026-03-19
Milestone: 🎯 Genesis Lab / NFT Trait Progression system now functionally alive with live player UX expansion, Discord DM ready-claim notifications, and ongoing production hardening

📋 TODAY – MARCH 19, 2026:
🧬 Genesis Lab / NFT Trait Progression System (✅ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH EXPANDED):

✅ New player-facing lab.html established as the Genesis NFT Research / Upgrade Lab

✅ Lab now loads:

player identity

DSPOINC summary

staking summary

mission / all-time / puzzle profile data

verified Genesis NFT collection

selected NFT detail state

trait research chamber

research queue

knowledge / explainer layer

✅ Core long-term architecture locked and implemented in working form:

verified NFT scan = immutable identity layer

trait upgrade table = progression layer

lab page = runtime merge of both

✅ This ensures:

upgrades belong to the NFT

current verified owner can use them

if NFT is sold and a new owner verifies it, progression remains with that NFT

verified scan data itself is never corrupted by progression logic

✅ Verified Genesis NFTs now render in lab

✅ Lab UX direction significantly advanced beyond the old dev-style version

✅ Genesis Lab now behaves more like a real gameplay hub and less like a raw developer overview

✅ Product direction now clearly locked as:

identity hub

NFT gallery / featured viewer

progression screen

trait upgrade chamber

future gameplay integration point

✅ Verified Genesis display direction changed from grid-first to featured viewer + slider pattern

✅ New structure now supports:

large selected Genesis mouse panel

verified collection slider

selected mouse snapshot

trait chamber below

cleaner holder-friendly navigation

✅ Selected Genesis viewer now shows:

image

NFT name

token id

trait slots

lab power

active research count

ready-to-claim count

selected mouse trait snapshot

✅ Verified Collection Slider now supports:

prev / next browsing

dropdown quick select

selected card centering in slider rail

view research action

✅ Slider sync logic stabilized

✅ Selection changes now update the left featured mouse correctly

✅ Verified collection rail now scrolls horizontally to the selected NFT instead of using unsafe generic page scroll behavior

✅ Trait preview / visual identity layer improved

✅ Trait data pipeline aligned

✅ Traits now normalize consistently across verification / storage / frontend:

Theme

Sub-Trait

Outfit

Accessories

Expression

Background

Special

✅ Trait matching design confirmed:

token_id

collection

trait_type

trait_value

✅ Upgrade system applies to exact trait value on exact NFT

✅ Locked progression rules preserved:

Genesis only

verified saved NFTs only

upgrades bound to exact NFT trait values

immutable verified NFT scan

separate progression table

1 active upgrade per NFT

infinite progression

exponential timing:

1→2 = 24h

2→3 = 48h

3→4 = 96h

doubles forward

explicit manual claim after finish

DSPOINC instant finish supported as progression path

✅ Upgrade backend first wave connected and working locally:

api/user/get-nft-trait-upgrades.php

api/user/start-nft-trait-upgrade.php

api/user/complete-nft-trait-upgrade.php

api/user/instant-finish-nft-trait-upgrade.php

✅ Local endpoint now returns:

success

verified_genesis_nfts

upgrades

✅ Upgrade table schema fixed locally

✅ Critical local SQL issue previously resolved:

old table lacked upgrade_id

✅ tbl_nft_trait_upgrades recreated with correct schema

✅ Table now supports:

upgrade_id

token_id

collection

trait_type

trait_value

current_level

upgrade_status

upgrade_started_at

upgrade_ends_at

last_completed_at

last_owner_user_id

timestamps

✅ This unblocked lab progression loading

✅ Full player upgrade loop now tested deeper than before:

start upgrade works

timers update

ready state displays

claim flow tested

instant finish path working

Discord notification integration working

✅ Important claim-state bug investigated and narrowed to frontend/server time interpretation mismatch risk

✅ Frontend time / readiness handling now recognized as a stability-sensitive area

✅ Discord DM Ready-to-Claim Notification System (NEW / WORKING):

✅ Discord bot now monitors ready-to-claim trait upgrades

✅ When a trait upgrade becomes ready, the bot DMs the matching Discord user

✅ DM includes:

NFT token / Genesis identifier

trait

level info

claim context

direct lab link

✅ Notification architecture added safely through bot-side polling against live DB

✅ No lab frontend notification hack used

✅ Stable bot-side design chosen intentionally

✅ New DB fields added to tbl_nft_trait_upgrades:

ready_claim_notified_at

ready_claim_notification_count

✅ Notification state reset / lifecycle integrated into upgrade flow

✅ Bot monitor now respects “send once per cycle” logic

✅ This created the first live player-return loop for Lab progression

✅ Lab UX / Theme Expansion (NEW PROGRESS):

✅ lab.html moved further away from dev-facing terminology

✅ Cleaner player-facing structure introduced

✅ Top area now explains the Lab as a real holder progression feature

✅ Quick-access and holder guidance blocks expanded

✅ CSS-only lab atmosphere work progressed:

enhanced dark chamber style

cheese-gold glow accents

mint-green / cyan lab accents

subtle lab pulse / glow improvements

active tab emphasis

active trait card visual emphasis

✅ Active trait card now visually stands out more when research is running

✅ “My Genesis Lab” tab visually highlighted as the main gameplay entry point

✅ Mint / Chamber Expansion CTA added to Lab

✅ Mint link integrated:

https://app.gensuki.xyz/Solana/NarrrfsWorldGenesis

✅ Lab now supports a mint-growth promotional layer:

stronger empty-state / no-Genesis attraction

holder-side “expand your chamber” messaging

cheese-gold attention styling

mint-green / cyan accent styling

animated pulse border direction

✅ Wording refined away from “specimen” and toward:

mouse

Genesis mouse

chamber

chamber slot

Genesis needed / chamber expansion direction

✅ Research Queue UX improved

✅ Queue now better supports actionable mouse navigation

✅ Direct flow added from queue / slider toward the actual research chamber

✅ Current slider/research navigation remains in active hardening because page-scroll behavior must stay stable on all screens

⚠️ Known remaining lab issues

⚠️ Slider / chamber jump behavior was improved but still remains a sensitive UX area when combining:

selection rerender

horizontal slider sync

scroll-to-research behavior

⚠️ Some recent “View Research” / chamber jump interactions caused page scroll bounce and need final stability-safe refinement

⚠️ Research Queue quick actions still need final polish so they always land cleanly in the actual chamber without scroll conflicts

⚠️ Runtime log / developer-facing log output still exists in the page and should be reduced or hidden for final player-facing polish

⚠️ Timezone / frontend readiness display remains a known sensitive area for claim-state truth if timestamps are interpreted differently in browser vs backend

⚠️ Selected NFT / trait chamber still needs final UX polish

⚠️ Economy-safe DSPOINC instant-finish audit still pending

⚠️ Final mobile-first polish still needed for some viewer / slider / chamber interactions

🔄 final production hardening and scroll/UX stabilization still ongoing

🎯 CURRENT PRIORITIES
Priority 1 — Finish Lab Production Hardening

finalize slider / chamber scroll behavior

finalize research queue jump flow

finalize selected NFT chamber UX

finalize trait research chamber UX polish

verify claim-state truth under all time conditions

remove misleading warnings / dev-facing leftovers

harden race-condition protection

Priority 2 — Expand Player Identity

continue richer player profile visibility

integrate progression state later into:

admin interface

Discord bot

game runtime readers

Priority 3 — Complete Admin Restoration

continue remaining admin tabs one by one

verify API calls

verify rendering

remove legacy fields safely

Priority 4 — Future Gameplay Integration

trait levels later drive:

multipliers

weapons

bonuses

unlocks

but gameplay consumption should not be wired until progression stability is fully proven

🚨 KNOWN RISK AREAS

ownership drift from stale verification data

duplicate upgrade starts from multi-click / multi-tab behavior

trait mismatch if exact trait keys are not enforced

DSPOINC instant-finish audit safety

infinite progression duration scaling at very high levels

frontend/backend time interpretation mismatch for ready/claim state

scroll bounce / UI race conditions in slider → chamber navigation

admin restoration regressions if done too broadly

All known. All should remain on incremental, stability-first handling.

📝 TIMELINE SYNC NOTE

This quick status has now been updated beyond the March 17 baseline and synced with the major March 18–19 work stream, especially:

lab UX restructuring

selected Genesis viewer + slider direction

mint CTA / chamber expansion messaging

Discord DM ready-to-claim notifications

active trait visual highlight work

tab emphasis / game-style lab theming

research queue and slider action improvements

scroll/jump hardening work

This closes the newest timeline gap between the earlier local lab baseline and the current player-facing Lab expansion work.
