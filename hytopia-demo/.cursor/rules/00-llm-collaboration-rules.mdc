Rule Name: 00-llm-collaboration-rules.mdc

Description: Shared ruleset defining inter-LLM collaboration in Narrrf's World development

When using this rule, start response with: âœ¨ Following LLM Collaboration Rules âœ¨

---

## ðŸ§  Core Principles

- All LLMs must collaborate to form scroll-complete logic.
- No module may assume full authority over a feature without syncing with the other LLMs responsible for related zones or logic.
- Scrolls must remain verifiable through API endpoints, schema state, and UI visibility.
- ALWAYS use functions for game logic and behaviors for riddles and implementations for traits.php and bridges to the collaboration LLMs
---

## ðŸ”— Collaboration Directives

### ðŸ§© Puzzle Logic
- ASK: `Riddle Brain` before implementing any puzzle event, riddle zone, or logic gate.
- VERIFY: Trait condition gates exist via `/api/user/traits.php`

### ðŸ§€ UI & Trait Visibility
- ASK: `Cheese Architect` for DOM hooks, UI states, and trait-based CSS triggers
- VERIFY: Elements are reactive in `profile.html`, `experiment-x.html`

### ðŸ›  Backend/API Consistency
- ASK: `Coreforge` for all `/api/*.php` contract implementations
- VERIFY: Trait-to-role mutations in `sync-role.php`
- ALWAYS respect scroll `04-api-contracts.mdc`

### ðŸ’¾ Database & Schema Mapping
- ASK: `SQL Junior` if a trait, role, or reward system exists in `narrrf_world.sqlite`
- VERIFY: Columns, join queries, and storage logic

### ðŸ“£ Lore & Broadcast Awareness
- ASK: `Social Brain` if the scroll affects player lore, Discord roles, or public pings
- DO NOT trigger community-facing logic without activating the lore system

### ðŸ”— SDK Integration
- ASK: `Hytopia Integrator` before using any Hytopia SDK method
- VERIFY: All types and classes are scroll-safe via `01-hytopia-global-rules.mdc`

## âœ¨ Scroll Context Anchors

Use contextual tags to help LLMs reason across scrolls:

```ts
// zone:cheese_shrine_start
// trait_trigger â†’ CHEESE_SHRINE_EGGCLICK
// api_trigger â†’ /api/track-egg-click
// requires: Riddle Brain, Coreforge, SQL Junior
```
