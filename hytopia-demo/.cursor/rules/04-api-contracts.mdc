Rule Name: 04-api-contracts.mdc

Description: Rules to follow when implementing and integrating API endpoints in Narrrfs World

When following this rule, start every response with: ✨ Following API Contract Rules ✨

## 🧠 Core Contract Philosophy

- ALWAYS use POST for state-changing endpoints (traits, clicks, rewards)
- NEVER call an API endpoint without verifying payload structure and response expectations
- ALWAYS treat trait, reward, and role APIs as user-state modifying actions requiring wallet or Discord ID
- ALWAYS mirror any new client-side trait or role gate with a corresponding PHP endpoint

## 🧩 Required Endpoints

### 🔑 POST /api/user/traits.php
Used when wallet connects, or trait gate is checked

Payload:
{
  "wallet": "0x123456..."
}

### 🎖️ POST /api/track-egg-click
Called when a player unlocks a trait from puzzle interaction

Payload:
{
  "wallet": "0xabc...",
  "traitKey": "CHEESE_SHRINE_EGGCLICK",
  "traitValue": true
}

### 📡 POST /api/event-trigger.php
Generic zone trigger / analytics system

Payload:
{
  "wallet": "0xabc...",
  "event": "puzzle_complete",
  "data": { "zone": "cheese_lab", "time": 1423 }
}

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 GET /api/user/roles.php
Returns current Discord role associations

Response:
{
  "roles": ["ALCHEMIST", "GENESIS_MOUSE", "REWARD_CLAIMER"]
}

### 🧬 GET /sync/sync-role.php
Syncs Discord roles to DB (runs via session context)

## 🔐 Contract Safety Rules

- Trait format: CHEESE_<ZONE>_<ACTION>
- Reject null or empty wallets
- Accept only `true` or `{}` as traitValue — no "ok", no arbitrary strings
- All POST must use application/json

## 🧠 LLM + Cursor Protocol

- Corebrain enforces API contract logic
- Coreforge ensures payloads match database expectations
- Hytopia Integrator wires fetch() to correct endpoint
- Riddle Brain links puzzles to /track-egg-click
- Cheese Architect binds DOM to /user/traits and /user/roles
- Cursor will not suggest unknown endpoints

## 📜 Footer Notes

// 📜 api-contracts.mdc active
// 🔐 Trait and reward APIs must be state-safe and properly typed
// 📡 All integrations must defer to this contract for endpoint usage
// 🧠 Do not create new endpoints unless scroll-authorized
