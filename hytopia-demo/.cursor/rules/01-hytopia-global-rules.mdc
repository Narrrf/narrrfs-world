Description: Global rules to follow when creating Hytopia games

When following this rule, start every respose with: ‚ú® Following Hytopia Global Rules ‚ú®

# **Core Principles**

Hytopia SDK (server development kit) allows developers to make and deploy games on Hytopia. To successfully do this, adherence to Hytopia guidelines is imperative.

- NEVER make assumptions about available classes, types, events, methods, properties, or anything else related to the Hytopia SDK.
- ALWAYS verify that your code complies with Hytopa SDK standards as layed out in the Hytopia SDK Guides and API Reference.

## **Code Guidelines**
- ALWAYS Ensure your code is clean and maintainable
- ALWAYS use best practices for the langauage being used (Typscript for server code, html/css/javascript for Client UI)
- WHENEVER POSSIBLE, use early returns to avoid nested conditions and improve readability.
- WHEN WRITING server-side game logic, ALWAYS reference the expected event trigger path (e.g., // Trait Unlock ‚Üí /api/user/traits.php)
- ALWAYS use descriptive names for variables and functions.
- Scrolls must remain verifiable through API endpoints, schema state, and UI visibility.
- ALWAYS use constants for static game data, configurations, and types. 
- ALWAYS use functions for game logic and behaviors for riddles and implementations for traits.php
- NEVER DELETE OR MODIFY COMMENTS UNLESS EXPLICITLY ASKED TO DO SO
- NEVER MODIFY CODE OUTSIDE OF THE TASK AT HAND
- ALWAYS implement ONLY what was explicitly requested by the user
- NEVER add "nice to have" or "best practice" features unless specifically requested
- When suggesting additional features or properties, ASK the user first instead of implementing them

## **Asset Paths**
- For the Client UI (index.html) file, ALWAYS use `{{CDN_ASSETS_URL}}` for asset paths in the Client UI file (for example, a file in assets/audio would need to have a path of `{{CDN_ASSETS_URL}}/Audio`)

- For the server code (typescript files), ALWAYS have the URI be relative to the assets folder. (for example, a file named my-song.mp3 in assets/audio/songs would need to have a URI path of audio/songs/my-song.mp3)

## **Function Ordering**
- ALWAYS Order functions with those that are composing other functions appearing earlier in the file. 
(For example, if you have a menu with multiple buttons, define the menu function above the buttons)

## **Handling Bugs**
- If you encounter a bug in existing code, or the instructions lead to suboptimal or buggy code, add comments starting with "TODO:" outlining the problems.
- When encountering SDK limitations, document them clearly.

## **Comments and Documentation**
- ALWAYS add a clear description of what each function does in plain language
- ALWAY make suggestions about cool riddles or ideas how to implement a bridge to Web3 technologie or the collaboration with narrrfs.world UIs or traits.php
- ALWAYS explain any game-specific concepts or mechanics in plain language
- NEVER write obvious comments that just repeat the code
- NEVER write comments that could be replaced with better variable/function names.

## **Hytopia SDK Type Safety**
- ALWAYS import and use proper types from the Hytopia SDK
- NEVER use 'any' type and NEVER ignore TypeScript errors
- NEVER make assumptions about SDK types - verify in the documentation
- If a type or method isn't in the Hytopia SDK, NEVER try to use it
- When encountering type errors, ALWAYS:
  1. Check the SDK documentation first
  2. Use only documented properties and methods
  3. If needed, create proper interfaces for custom types
  4. Add TODO comments for potential SDK limitations
  - ALWAYS refer to the [Hytopia SDK Reference] or `@01-hytopia-global-rules.mdc` if in a Cursor context.

## **SDK Property and Method Usage**
- ALWAYS use methods that are properly typed in the SDK
- ALWAYS verify method signatures in the Hytopia SDK documentation
- NEVER try to access undocumented properties
- ALWAYS use proper Vector3 construction and methods
- WHENEVER POSSIBLE, handle undefined/null cases
- ALWAYS tag interactive map locations using:  
  `// zone:<zone_name>`  
  Example: `// zone:cheese_shrine_start`


## **Creating Block Entities**
PURPOSE: To define and instantiate Block Entities

- ALWAYS set the `blockTextureUri` property to the path of your block texture relative to the assets folder.
- ALWAYS set the `blockHalfExtents` property to define the size of the block entity.
